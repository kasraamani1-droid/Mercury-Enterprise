## 1. Purpose

Mercury Careers connects aviation employers with certified talent, binding job requirements to competency and authorization concepts already modeled in personnel — without becoming a generic job board.

---

## 2. Positioning

Mercury Careers is a named commercial and architectural product within the Mercury Aviation Enterprise Operating System. It does not ship a separate database or a divergent security model. It packages capabilities on **Mercury Core** so buyers recognize their operating role while the **Digital Thread** remains continuous.

---

## 3. Target users

- Airlines, MROs, CAMOs hiring
- Licensed technicians and engineers

---

## 4. Business capabilities

| Capability | Status |
|------------|--------|
| Personnel and authorizations | Delivered foundation |
| Careers portal and matching | Planned |

---

## 5. Major entities

Employee, Authorization, License (foundation); JobRequisition, Application (target).

---

## 6. Relationships to the Digital Thread

Every mutation that affects configuration, airworthiness evidence, material, tooling, or certification must persist resolvable references (aircraft, task/work, publication revision, actor, organization). See [Digital Airworthiness Passport](../../10_Platform/Digital_Airworthiness_Passport.md) and [ADR-0002](../../08_Standards/ADR/ADR-0002-digital-thread-passport.md).

---

## 7. APIs

Future `/api/v1/careers/*`; personnel APIs today.

All APIs follow [API Standards](../../08_Standards/API_Standards.md) and organization isolation ([Multi-Tenant Standards](../../08_Standards/Multi_Tenant_Standards.md)).

---

## 8. Security

| Control | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| RBAC | Product permissions subset of the central catalogue |
| Org isolation | Service-layer enforcement on every query |
| Audit | Fail-closed on safety-critical mutations |
| AI | Advisory only if AI surfaces are included |

See [RBAC](../../06_Security/RBAC.md) · [Audit](../../06_Security/Audit.md) · [Zero Trust](../../10_Platform/Zero_Trust_Architecture.md).
