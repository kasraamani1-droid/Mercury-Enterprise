## 1. Purpose

Mercury Marketplace is the ecosystem commerce layer for verified apps, services, training offerings, and (selectively) material/service listings that respect multi-tenant isolation and supplier verification.

---

## 2. Positioning

Mercury Marketplace is a named commercial and architectural product within the Mercury Aviation Enterprise Operating System. It does not ship a separate database or a divergent security model. It packages capabilities on **Mercury Core** so buyers recognize their operating role while the **Digital Thread** remains continuous.

- ISVs and training orgs
- Verified suppliers

## 6. Relationships to the Digital Thread

Every mutation that affects configuration, airworthiness evidence, material, tooling, or certification must persist resolvable references (aircraft, task/work, publication revision, actor, organization). See [Digital Airworthiness Passport](../../10_Platform/Digital_Airworthiness_Passport.md) and [ADR-0002](../../08_Standards/ADR/ADR-0002-digital-thread-passport.md).

---

## 7. APIs

Future `/api/v1/marketplace/*`; today governed by Marketplace Architecture/Standards only.

All APIs follow [API Standards](../../08_Standards/API_Standards.md) and organization isolation ([Multi-Tenant Standards](../../08_Standards/Multi_Tenant_Standards.md)).

---

## 8. Security

| Control | Application |
|---------|-------------|
| RBAC | Product permissions subset of the central catalogue |
| Org isolation | Service-layer enforcement on every query |
| Audit | Fail-closed on safety-critical mutations |
| AI | Advisory only if AI surfaces are included |

See [RBAC](../../06_Security/RBAC.md) · [Audit](../../06_Security/Audit.md) · [Zero Trust](../../10_Platform/Zero_Trust_Architecture.md).
